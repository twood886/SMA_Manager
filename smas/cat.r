  # 1.4	“Securities” shall mean all securities held as investments in the
  #    Investment Account, provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties
  #    in writing, only the following types of Securities may be purchased or
  #    sold for the Investment Account, subject to the Investment Guidelines and
  #    in accordance with any other terms of this Agreement: 
  
  # 1.4(a) publicly traded equity and convertible securities of issuers
  #    organized and traded in the United States, including exchange-traded funds
  #    (“ETFs”) of United States issuers;


  # 1.4(b) publicly traded equity and convertible securities of issuers
  #    organized in countries other than the United States are permitted only if
  #    both of the following conditions are met: 
  
  # 1.4(b)(i) such instruments are traded in the markets set forth on Schedule II
  #    to this Agreement, as may be amended from time to time with Client’s
  #    written approval, and such other markets in which Client has established
  #    execution and clearance capabilities as determined by Client in its sole
  #    discretion and communicated to Investment Manager in writing
  #    (collectively, “Other Permitted Markets”); and 

  # 1.4(b)(ii) any such securities of issuers organized in an Other Permitted
  #    Market are traded as a total return swap;

  # 1.4(c) equity-linked derivatives, including both listed and over-the-counter
  #    (“OTC”) options and swaps, on (i) equity securities described in the
  #    foregoing clauses (a) and (b) and (ii) indices; and

  # 1.4(d) futures instruments and options on futures (including commodities and
  #    commodity ETFs) (collectively, “Futures”).  


  # 3.5	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
  # 3.5(a) If Investment Manager plans to engage in any activity that would be
  #    reasonably expected to require the filing of a Schedule 13D with respect
  #    to any issuer pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of
  #    1934, as amended, the Investment Account shall (i) not purchase any
  #    securities of such issuer and (ii) the Investment Manager will sell any
  #    such securities to the extent held in the Account prior to filing a
  #    Schedule 13D.

  # 3.5(b) No portion of the Investment Account will be invested in securities
  #    that are designated by either of Client or CAAM as restricted. Each of
  #    Client and CAAM may amend from time to time the list of securities
  #    designated as restricted by a communication in writing to Investment
  #    Manager. Investment Manager shall not otherwise effect any transactions
  #    on behalf of the Investment Account in securities that are designated by
  #    Client and/or CAAM as prohibited (and so communicated to Investment
  #    Manager in writing), in each case until Client and/or CAAM, as applicable,
  #    has notified Investment Manager in writing that such restriction/
  #    prohibition is waived or is no longer in effect. Upon written instruction
  #    from Client, Investment Manager shall cause the Investment Account to
  #    promptly dispose of securities which are designated as restricted or
  #    prohibited in accordance with the foregoing; provided, that Client shall
  #    not instruct Investment Manager to dispose of securities in violation of
  #    applicable law (e.g., for which Client or CAAM are in possession of
  #    material non-public information).

  # 3.5(c) Investment Manager shall not cause the Investment Account to invest
  #    in (i) any securities, companies or transactions that are the subject of
  #    any sanctions administered or enforced by the U.S. Department of
  #    Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (including, but not limited
  #    to, U.S. Executive Order 13959, as amended—Addressing the Threat From
  #    Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies,
  #    U.S. Executive Order 13936, as amended—The President’s Executive Order on
  #    Hong Kong Normalization, U.S. Executive Order 14024—Blocking Property with
  #    respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the
  #    Russian Federation and related directives and U.S. Executive Order
  #    14065—Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting Certain
  #    Transactions with respect to Continued Russian Efforts to Undermine the
  #    Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine), HM Treasury’s Office
  #    for Financial Sanctions Implementation, the United Nations Security
  #    Council, the European Union, the World Bank, or any other relevant
  #    sanctions authority (collectively, “Sanctions”);
  
  #3.5(c) or (ii) a country or territory that is, or becomes while this Agreement
  #    is in effect, the subject of comprehensive Sanctions (currently Crimea,
  #    Cuba, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, Iran, the so-called
  #    Luhansk People’s Republic, North Korea, and Syria).
