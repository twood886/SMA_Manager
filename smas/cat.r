  # 3.5	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
  # 3.5(a) If Investment Manager plans to engage in any activity that would be
  #    reasonably expected to require the filing of a Schedule 13D with respect

  #    securities of such issuer and (ii) the Investment Manager will sell any
  #    such securities to the extent held in the Account prior to filing a
  #    Schedule 13D.

  # 3.5(b) No portion of the Investment Account will be invested in securities

  #    Manager in writing), in each case until Client and/or CAAM, as applicable,
  #    has notified Investment Manager in writing that such restriction/
  #    prohibition is waived or is no longer in effect. Upon written instruction
  #    from Client, Investment Manager shall cause the Investment Account to
  #    promptly dispose of securities which are designated as restricted or
  #    prohibited in accordance with the foregoing; provided, that Client shall
  #    not instruct Investment Manager to dispose of securities in violation of
  #    applicable law (e.g., for which Client or CAAM are in possession of
  #    material non-public information).
