\usage{
proposed_to_trade(proposed_trade_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{proposed_trade_df}{A data frame containing the proposed trades. 
The data frame must have the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{portfolio_id}{A string representing the portfolio ID.}
  \item{security_id}{A string representing the security ID.}
  \item{trade_qty}{A numeric value representing the trade quantity.}
  \item{swap}{A boolean indicating whether the trade is a swap.}
}}
}
\value{
Returns `TRUE` invisibly after successfully processing all trades.
}
\description{
This function processes a data frame of proposed trades and executes them
by calling an internal `.trade` function for each row in the data frame.
}
\details{
The function validates the input data frame to ensure it has the required
structure and types for each column. It then iterates over each row of the
data frame and executes the trade using the `.trade` function.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
proposed_trades <- data.frame(
  portfolio_id = c("P1", "P2"),
  security_id = c("S1", "S2"),
  trade_qty = c(100, 200),
  swap = c(TRUE, FALSE)
)
proposed_to_trade(proposed_trades)
