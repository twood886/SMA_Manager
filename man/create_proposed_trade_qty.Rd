\usage{
create_proposed_trade_qty(
  portfolio_id = NULL,
  security_id = NULL,
  trade_qty = NULL,
  swap = FALSE,
  flow_to_derived = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{portfolio_id}{A string representing the ID of the portfolio. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{security_id}{A vector of strings representing the IDs of the securities. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{trade_qty}{A numeric vector representing the trade quantities for the securities. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{swap}{A named logical vector indicating whether to swap for each security. The names should match the `security_id`.}

\item{flow_to_derived}{A logical value indicating whether to propagate the proposed trades to derived portfolios. Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the proposed trade quantities with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{portfolio_id}{The ID of the portfolio.}
  \item{security_id}{The ID of the security.}
  \item{trade_qty}{The proposed trade quantity for the security.}
  \item{swap}{A logical value indicating whether to swap for the security.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the proposed trade quantities for a given portfolio and securities.
It also supports propagating the proposed trades to derived portfolios if specified.
